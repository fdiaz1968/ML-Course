For example, deep neural networks with many layers and nodes can capture more complex patterns than a single-layer perceptron.\n","\n","* Feature Space: The number of features or predictors used in the model also contributes to its complexity. More features can allow a model to capture more information about the data, but they also increase the risk of overfitting.\n","\n","* Interaction and Polynomial Terms: Models that include interaction terms (products of features) or polynomial terms (features raised to a power) can capture more complex relationships but are also more complex themselves."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Consequences of Model Complexity\n","\n","\n","* With increased model complexity comes the risk of **overfitting**, where the model learns the noise or random fluctuations in the training data instead of the underlying distribution.

independent variables are highly collinear, Ridge regression can be utilized to tackle such situations.\n","\n","- When we have more parameters than samples,  using Ridge Regression can help.\n","\n","- The (optimal) value of $\\lambda$ is typically obtained using **Cross Validation** ( https://towardsdatascience.com/cross-validation-explained-evaluating-estimator-performance-e51e5430ff85 , https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### The $\\lambda$ parameter\n","\n","In $L_2$ regularization, the regularization term added to the cost function is $\\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\beta^2$, where $\\lambda$ is the regularization parameter, and $\\beta_i$ are the model parameters. This regularization term penalizes large values of parameters, thereby constraining their magnitude.\n","\n","When visualizing this in a two-parameter space $(\\beta_1, \\beta_2)$, the constraint imposed by the $L_2$ norm can be represented as a circle because all points $(\\beta_1, \\beta_2)$ that satisfy the equation $\\beta_1^2 + \\beta_2^2 = c$ (for some constant $c$) lie on a circle centered at the origin. This circle represents the boundary within which the parameter values must lie to not incur a penalty larger than a certain threshold.\n","\n","However, the radius of this circle is not directly proportional to $\\lambda$. Instead, the value of $\\lambda$ influences the strength of the penalty for parameters being away from zero. A higher $\\lambda$ means a stronger penalty for parameters being away from zero, effectively shrinking the coefficients towards zero and making the model simpler (or more regularized).\n","\n","In the context of the circle analogy, while $\\lambda$ itself does not set the radius, it influences how much the model's parameters are constrained in terms of their magnitude. For a given level of regularization (fixed $\\lambda$), the optimal parameters $\\beta_1, \\beta_2$ must lie within a certain distance from the origin, corresponding to a specific \"allowable\" region under the $L_2$ penalty. The actual \"radius\" in this analogy corresponds to the maximum allowable magnitude of the parameters before incurring too much penalty, and this threshold is indirectly influenced by $\\lambda$, but not in a directly proportional manner. The primary effect of increasing $\\lambda$ is to increase the penalty on the magnitude of the parameters, pushing them to be smaller.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wk0OWM0El5ep"},"source":["### Ridge Regression with Default Parameters"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Let's fit a Ridge Regression model to our data:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":75},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":415,"status":"ok","timestamp":1700130939894,"user":{"displayName":"Fernando Diaz","userId":"16819680563727310863"},"user_tz":180},"id":"OSQx2nrYl5ep","outputId":"a2a198b4-e0c7-4b25-f26f-cb4f19aec187"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<style>#sk-container-id-1 {\n","  /* Definition of color scheme common for light and dark mode */\n","  --sklearn-color-text: black;\n","  --sklearn-color-line: gray;\n","  /* Definition of color scheme for unfitted estimators */\n","  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-0: #fff5e6;\n","  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-1: #f6e4d2;\n","  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-2: #ffe0b3;\n","  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-3: chocolate;\n","  /* Definition of color scheme for fitted estimators */\n","  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-0: #f0f8ff;\n","  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-1: #d4ebff;\n","  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-2: #b3dbfd;\n","  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-3: cornflowerblue;\n","\n","  /* Specific color for light theme */\n","  --sklearn-color-text-on-default-background: var(--sg-text-color, var(--theme-code-foreground, var(--jp-content-font-color1, black)));\n","  --sklearn-color-background: var(--sg-background-color, var(--theme-background, var(--jp-layout-color0, white)));\n","  --sklearn-color-border-box: var(--sg-text-color, var(--theme-code-foreground, var(--jp-content-font-color1, black)));\n","  --sklearn-color-icon: #696969;\n","\n","  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n","    /* Redefinition of color scheme for dark theme */\n","    --sklearn-color-text-on-default-background: var(--sg-text-color, var(--theme-code-foreground, var(--jp-content-font-color1, white)));\n","    --sklearn-color-background: var(--sg-background-color, var(--theme-background, var(--jp-layout-color0, #111)));\n","    --sklearn-color-border-box: var(--sg-text-color, var(--theme-code-foreground, var(--jp-content-font-color1, white)));\n","    --sklearn-color-icon: #878787;\n","  }\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-1 {\n","  color: var(--sklearn-color-text);\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-1 pre {\n","  padding: 0;\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-1 input.sk-hidden--visually {\n","  border: 0;\n","  clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);\n","  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\n","  height: 1px;\n","  margin: -1px;\n","  overflow: hidden;\n","  padding: 0;\n","  position: absolute;\n","  width: 1px;\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-dashed-wrapped {\n","  border: 1px dashed var(--sklearn-color-line);\n","  margin: 0 0.4em 0.5em 0.4em;\n","  box-sizing: border-box;\n","  padding-bottom: 0.4em;\n","  background-color: var(--sklearn-color-background);\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-container {\n","  /* jupyter's `normalize.less` sets `[hidden] { display: none;

As a result, it performs a more efficient smoothing process.\n","\n","Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression model that combines the penalties of the Ridge and Lasso regression methods. It is particularly useful when there are multiple features correlated with each other. In such cases, Lasso might select only one variable from a group of correlated variables, while Ridge might include all, but not necessarily with the significance needed for model interpretation. Elastic Net aims to balance out these aspects by blending the penalties of Ridge and Lasso, potentially providing a model that maintains a good balance between feature selection and regularization.\n","\n","The cost function for Elastic Net Regression as a minimization problem is formulated to combine the regularization properties of both Ridge (L2 norm) and Lasso (L1 norm) regression. It aims to minimize the following objective function:\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{Minimize} \\, J(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{2n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - x_i^T \\beta)^2 + \\lambda_1 \\sum_{j=1}^{k} |\\beta_j| + \\frac{\\lambda_2}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\beta_j^2\n","$$\n","\n","where $\\beta_j$ represents the coefficient of the $j^{th}$ predictor, $k$ is the total number of predictors, $\\lambda_1$ is the weighting of the L1 penalty (Lasso), and $\\lambda_2$ is the weighting of the L2 penalty (Ridge).\n","\n","The first term in this function is the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS), which measures the fit of the model to the data. The second term is the L1 penalty, which promotes sparsity in the coefficients (leading to feature selection). The third term is the L2 penalty, which encourages the shrinkage of the coefficients and helps to deal with multicollinearity by ensuring the coefficients stay relatively small and more stable.\n","\n","Elastic Net allows for a trade-off between Lasso and Ridge regularization, controlled by the parameters $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$. In practice, these parameters are chosen through a process such as cross-validation to optimize the model's performance on unseen data, balancing the bias-variance trade-off.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### The $L_1$ Ratio Parameter\n","\n","When incorporating the $L_1$ ratio parameter into the Elastic Net Regression cost function, the formulation adjusts to balance the mix of $L_1$ and $L_2$ penalties based on a single parameter, often denoted as $\\alpha$ for the overall strength of the regularization and $l1\\_ratio$ for the mix between $L_1$ and $L_2$ penalties.
